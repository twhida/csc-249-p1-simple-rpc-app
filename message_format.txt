A document with a written description of your client-server message format 
(that is, a description of all implemented client and server messages, and 
how the various components of each message are represented). This document 
must also briefly summarize what your client-server application does, and 
provide examples of expected output for all implemented RPC operations. 
Your goal in writing this document should be to convey enough information 
in enough detail to allow a competent programmer without access to your 
source code to write either a new client that communicates properly with 
your server, or a new server that communicates properly with your client. 
This document should include at least five sections: Overview of Application, 
Client->Server Message Format, Server->Client Message Format, Example Output, 
Acknowledgments.
